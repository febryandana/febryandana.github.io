My name is Moch. Febryandana Nurfahri. Born in East Java, Indonesia. I love learning computer stuff. But I'm such a generalist that didn't master only one thing. I like to learning whatever pick my interest.

For now, I like to explore the Infrastructure and DevOps's domain. In this digital era, I realize that everything would need computerization and internet. And I want to be a part of it, to be someone useful. Hence why I trying to learn computer stuff, network infrastructure, devops, system administration, etc.

Apart from those, I also like to juggling with IoT, microcontroller, and stuff. I love to create and break something, even if it's useless. Because that way I can try to make something new, something that maybe useful.
